STATA code for the publication in Journal of Neurotrauma (2024) entitled: Economic Optimisation through Adherence to Best Practice Guidelines: A Decision Analysis of Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury Care Pathways in Australia
In this economic analysis modelling study, we used record-linked administrative patient data from New South Wales, Australia to construct a decision tree model to compare the economic cost of acute care for patients with TSCI under current clinical pathways with a optimal care (consensus guidelines-informed) modelled pathway. The optimal care pathway included direct transfer to specialist SCI Unit (SCIU) or indirect transfer to SCIU within 24 hours of injury, surgical intervention within 12 hours of injury, and subsequent inpatient rehabilitation. Propensity score matching with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to reduce potential confounding from baseline differences in patient characteristics. A Generalised Linear Model regression with gamma distribution and log link, weighted with IPTW scores, was used for costs and length of stay estimations to reduce any residual bias. Sensitivity analyses quantified the sensitivity of the findings to key model parameters.
